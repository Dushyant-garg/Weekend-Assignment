## Usage Examples

    "userIds": [2, 4, 5, 6]
  }'
```

### Example 3: Project Monitoring

```bash
# Check overdue projects
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/projects/overdue" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Get all active projects
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/projects/status/ACTIVE" \

```

## Database Schema

The project management system creates these tables:

- **projects**: Main project information
- **project_team_members**: Many-to-many relationship between projects and users

### Project Table Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | Long | Primary key |
| name | String | Project name |
| description | String | Project description |
| scope | String | Project scope |
| start_date | LocalDate | Project start date |
| deadline | LocalDate | Project deadline |
| status | Enum | Project status |
| manager_id | Long | ID of project manager |
| created_at | LocalDateTime | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | LocalDateTime | Last update timestamp |

## Getting Started

1. **Register users** that will be project managers and team members
2. **Create projects** with one user as the manager
3. **Add team members** to the projects
4. **Set deadlines and scope** as needed
5. **Track progress** using status updates

The system is simple and focused on core project management needs without unnecessary complexity.
